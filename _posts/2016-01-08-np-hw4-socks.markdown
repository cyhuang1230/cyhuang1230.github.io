In this [network programming](/NCTU_NP) homework, we are asked to build <b>SOCKS4 server and client</b> and combine HW3 to demo.

Spec is not included; however, the basic architecture can be illustrated as follows:
![rbs_diagram](/resources/np_hw4_diagram.svg)


There are some notable ideas I came up with:<br/>

***For SOCKS client (CGI):***<br/>
- Same as HW3. Just need to send SOCK4 requset and handle SOCK4 reply.<br/>

***For SOCKS Server:***<br/>

\- `CONNECT` mode procedure:<br/>

~~~
accept → read SOCKS req → check firewall rules →
connect to dest host → send SOCKS reply → redirect data
~~~

\- `BIND` mode procedure:<br/>

~~~
accept → read SOCKS req → check firewall rules →
bind socket → listen → send SOCKS reply → 
accpet from server → send SOCKS reply (to original client) → redirect data
~~~

\- When redirecting data, should avoid using `strncpy` since it may contain `'\0'` in data,
which occasionally leads to data error (less bytes are copied than expected).<br/>
\- When `bind` with system-assigned port, give `0` to `sockaddr_in.sin_port`.<br/>

<b>For SOCKS client</b> (CGI):<br/>
Please look for `NP_project4_Server.cpp`. <br/>
To try: `make hw4_cgi `, upload to a HTTP server and run `<BASE_URL>/hw4.cgi`. <br/>

<b>For SOCKS server</b>:<br/>
Please look for `NP_project4_Server.cpp`. <br/>
To try: `make hw4_server ` and run `./np_hw4`. <br/>
